# Autocomplete, Markov, and Huffman Coding

## Introduction

In my journey of software development, I've undertaken three projects that showcase my ability to tackle complex algorithmic challenges and create efficient and functional solutions. These projects encompass various aspects of modern software applications, from autocomplete algorithms to generative text modeling and data compression techniques.

## Project 1: Autocomplete

Autocomplete is a fundamental feature that enhances user experience by providing real-time suggestions as users type. I embarked on building a robust autocomplete algorithm employing both Binary Search and Hash Map techniques.

I crafted a **PrefixComparator** class to compare prefixes efficiently, coupled with methods like **firstIndex** and **lastIndex** in **BinarySearchLibrary** for optimal retrieval of suggestions. I then extended the **Autocompletor** class to implement the **topMatches** method in **BinarySearchAutocomplete**, offering efficient prediction and display of the most relevant suggestions.

A novel approach, **HashListAutocomplete**, was implemented, leveraging the power of Hash Maps to predict user input efficiently and suggest fitting completions.

The projects were benchmarked and analyzed, highlighting the strengths and trade-offs of each approach, demonstrating my keen understanding of algorithmic performance.

## Project 2: Markov Text Generation

Building upon my achievements in the first project, I delved into generative text modeling using Markov Chains. In this multipart project, I developed **EfficientMarkov** and **EfficientWordMarkov** implementations to generate text that closely mimics a given training text.

By incorporating efficient data structures like HashMaps, I enhanced the runtime performance of text generation while maintaining the accuracy of the content. Benchmarks showcased the substantial improvements gained from my implementations, and insightful analysis illuminated the nuanced trade-offs between different methods.

## Project 3: Huffman Coding

Lastly, I ventured into the realm of data compression with Huffman Coding. This technique, rooted in creating compact representations for data, involves both compression and decompression processes.

In the **HuffProcessor** class, I meticulously implemented the Huffman Coding algorithm to compress and decompress data efficiently. The algorithm entails determining character frequencies, creating a Huffman tree, generating encodings, and performing compression and decompression based on this structure.

Through comprehensive benchmarking and analysis, I scrutinized the efficiency of Huffman Coding and its impact on data compression, thereby demonstrating my prowess in handling intricate encoding techniques.

## Conclusion

These projects collectively reflect my dedication to creating sophisticated and optimized software solutions. By mastering autocomplete algorithms, generative text modeling, and data compression techniques, I have showcased my ability to solve multifaceted challenges and contribute effectively to the world of software development.
